this file should be an explanation of how the app works, a sternly worded warning on the app being beta, and a link to twitter_login.php to get started.

flow:

index.html: this page
twitter_login.php: redirects to twitter to get app auth
step1.php: form to input username. (later versions: checkbox for replies/RTs)
step2.php: send data to backend, refresh to step3.php
step3.php: refresh loop until status = done
step4.php: get_list on backend, read to memory. create output of userids in form of csv, download.

this seems like more steps that are necessary, but it leaves some room for further features without having to drastically change the flow.

    <h1>Shields Up</h1>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <p>This is a <strong>very early beta</strong>! Use at your own risk.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Shields Up aims to mitigate the flood of tweets that can inundate
    a user when a single account publicly mentions their twitter handle.
    Instead of using a follower list as a source for accounts to block,
    we build our list based off of interactions such as retweets of the offending
    user.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>After logging into twitter, you will be asked to enter a username
    that is the source of unwanted attention toward you. Shields Up will
    gather a list of accounts that may be likely to follow a dogpile request,
    based on followers, retweets, and/or replies. You will then be prompted
    to download a list of user ids that can be imported via Twitter's
    <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/sharing-block-lists-to-help-make-twitter-safer">
    new block import</a>, available from your
    <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/blocked">Twitter Settings</a> page.
    Note that the rollout is expected to take several weeks; you may not have
    this option available yet.</p>

    <p>Shields Up is an Open Source project by OAPI. The backend is Ruby
    and the frontend is PHP. Feel free to review/contribute at

    <h2>Still want to try it?</h2>
    <p>If you are certain you want to try Shields Up in its BETA state,
    <a href="twitter_login.php">proceed on</a>.</p>
