<h1>Shields Up</h1>

<div class="warning">
    <h3>Warning</h3>
    <p>This is a <strong>very early beta</strong>! Use at your own risk.</p>
</div>

<p>Shields Up aims to mitigate the flood of tweets that can inundate
a user when a single account publicly mentions their twitter handle.
Instead of using a follower list as a source for accounts to block,
we build our list based off of interactions such as retweets of the offending
user.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>After logging into twitter, you will be asked to enter a username
that is the source of unwanted attention toward you. Shields Up will
gather a list of accounts that may be likely to follow a dogpile request,
based on followers, retweets, and/or replies. You will then be prompted
to download a list of user ids that can be imported via Twitter's
<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/sharing-block-lists-to-help-make-twitter-safer">
new block import</a>, available from your
<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/blocked">Twitter Settings</a> page.
Note that the rollout is expected to take several weeks; you may not have
this option available yet.</p>

<p>Shields Up is an Open Source project by OAPI. The backend is Ruby
and the frontend is PHP. Feel free to review/contribute at
